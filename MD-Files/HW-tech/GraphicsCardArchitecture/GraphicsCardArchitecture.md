# Hardware - Cheatsheet - Graphics Card Architecture

### Introduction
A graphics card is an essential component in a computer system that is responsible for generating and displaying images on a monitor or screen. The architecture of a graphics card is a complex system of hardware and software components that work together to process and render graphical data. In this technical documentation, we will delve deep into the architecture of graphics cards, discussing the various components, their functions, and how they interact with each other.

### Components of a Graphics Card
A graphics card is made up of several components that work together to process graphical data. These components include:

#### 1. GPU
The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is the most important component of a graphics card. It is a specialized processor designed specifically for handling graphical computations. The GPU contains hundreds or even thousands of smaller processing cores that work in parallel to perform calculations needed to render graphics on a screen.

#### 2. Memory
A graphics card also has its memory, which is used to store data temporarily while it is being processed. The memory used in a graphics card is called Graphics Random Access Memory (GRAM) or Video Random Access Memory (VRAM). It is faster than the system memory (RAM) of a computer and is designed specifically for handling graphical data.

#### 3. Cooling System
The GPU generates a lot of heat while processing graphical data, so a graphics card requires a cooling system to prevent overheating. The cooling system usually consists of a heatsink and a fan that work together to dissipate the heat generated by the GPU.

#### 4. Output Interfaces
A graphics card has one or more output interfaces that are used to connect the card to a monitor or screen. The most common output interfaces include HDMI, DisplayPort, and VGA.

#### 5. Power Connectors
A graphics card requires a significant amount of power to operate. It has one or more power connectors that are used to connect the card to the power supply unit (PSU) of a computer.

### GPU Architecture
The GPU is the most important component of a graphics card, and its architecture plays a critical role in the card's performance. The architecture of a GPU can be divided into several components:

#### 1. Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)
The GPU contains several streaming multiprocessors (SMs) that are responsible for performing the majority of the processing tasks. Each SM contains hundreds or thousands of smaller processing cores that work in parallel to perform calculations needed to render graphics on a screen.

#### 2. Memory Interface
The memory interface is responsible for managing the flow of data between the GPU and the memory. It determines the speed at which data can be transferred between the GPU and memory.

#### 3. Texture Units
The texture units are responsible for applying textures to the surface of 3D objects. They sample textures from the memory and apply them to the surfaces of 3D objects.

#### 4. Rasterizer
The rasterizer is responsible for converting 3D objects into 2D images. It performs this task by projecting 3D objects onto a 2D plane.

#### 5. Render Output Units (ROPs)
The render output units (ROPs) are responsible for blending the output of the rasterizer and the texture units to produce the final image that is displayed on the screen. They perform this task by combining the different components of the image, such as color, depth, and stencil.

### Memory Architecture
The memory architecture of a graphics card is designed specifically for handling graphical data. It is optimized for high bandwidth and low latency, which are critical for rendering complex 3D graphics in real-time. The memory architecture of a graphics card can be divided into several components:

#### 1. Memory Controller

The memory controller is the component responsible for managing the flow of data between the GPU and memory. It is usually located on the same chip as the GPU and is responsible for controlling the memory bus, which is the interface between the GPU and the memory.

The memory controller determines the speed at which data can be transferred between the GPU and memory. It is designed to optimize the memory bandwidth and reduce latency, which are critical for achieving high performance in graphics-intensive applications.

Most modern graphics cards use a technology called GDDR (Graphics Double Data Rate) memory, which is a type of SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory) that is optimized for handling graphical data. GDDR memory provides high bandwidth and low latency, making it ideal for rendering complex 3D graphics in real-time.

The memory controller also includes a cache hierarchy that is used to reduce the memory latency and improve the overall performance of the graphics card. The cache hierarchy includes several levels of caches, with each level having a smaller but faster cache than the previous level.

The cache hierarchy is used to store frequently accessed data and instructions, reducing the number of memory accesses required and improving the overall performance of the graphics card.

In addition to the memory controller, the memory architecture of a graphics card may also include other components such as memory chips, memory banks, and memory controllers. These components work together to provide high bandwidth and low latency memory access, which is critical for achieving high performance in graphics-intensive applications.

#### 2. Memory Chips
Memory chips are physical components that store data in the graphics card's memory. They are usually located on a separate PCB (Printed Circuit Board) on the graphics card and are connected to the memory controller via the memory bus.

The amount of memory in a graphics card can vary depending on the card's specifications and intended use. Most modern graphics cards have at least 4GB or 8GB of memory, with high-end cards having as much as 24GB or more.

Memory chips are usually organized into memory banks, with each bank having a certain amount of memory. The number of memory banks in a graphics card can vary, with some cards having just one bank and others having multiple banks.

#### 3. Memory Bandwidth
Memory bandwidth is the rate at which data can be transferred between the GPU and memory. It is a critical factor in the performance of a graphics card, as high bandwidth is required to render complex 3D graphics in real-time.

Memory bandwidth is determined by the speed of the memory clock and the width of the memory bus. The memory clock is the frequency at which the memory chips operate, while the memory bus is the interface between the GPU and memory.

Most modern graphics cards use GDDR memory, which is optimized for handling graphical data. GDDR memory has a high memory clock speed and a wide memory bus, providing high bandwidth and low latency memory access.

#### 4. Memory Controllers
Memory controllers are responsible for managing the flow of data between the GPU and memory. They are usually located on the same chip as the GPU and are designed to optimize the memory bandwidth and reduce latency.

Memory controllers include a cache hierarchy that is used to reduce the memory latency and improve the overall performance of the graphics card. The cache hierarchy includes several levels of caches, with each level having a smaller but faster cache than the previous level.

The cache hierarchy is used to store frequently accessed data and instructions, reducing the number of memory accesses required and improving the overall performance of the graphics card.

#### 5. Memory Compression
Memory compression is a technique used in modern graphics cards to increase the effective memory bandwidth. It works by compressing the data before it is stored in memory, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the GPU and memory.

Memory compression is especially useful for graphics cards with limited memory bandwidth, as it can help to improve the performance of the card without requiring additional memory or a wider memory bus.

### Conclusion
The memory architecture of a graphics card is a complex system of hardware and software components that work together to provide high bandwidth and low latency memory access. It includes components such as memory chips, memory controllers, and memory compression techniques, which are all designed to optimize the performance of the graphics card. Understanding the memory architecture of a graphics card is essential for selecting the right card for your needs and optimizing its performance.
